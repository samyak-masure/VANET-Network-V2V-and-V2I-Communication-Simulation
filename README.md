# About VANET-Network-V2V-and-V2I-Communication-Simulation

This project is a lightweight simulator that shows how vehicles communicate wirelessly in a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET).


FEATURES 

1. Real-Time Simulation in Pygame

   Vehicles move dynamically on the road and automatically connect when they come within range.
   You can observe the network form and break connections as cars move â€” giving a clear view of how VANETs behave on the road.

2. Live Log Table
   The simulator includes a Tkinter-based log table that displays live simulation events.
   It updates in real-time as the simulation runs, showing details such as:

   - Vehicle IDs involved in communication

   - Message sent or received

   - Connection status (established, dropped, etc.)

   - Simulation time
